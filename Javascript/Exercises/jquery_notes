//Way to use jquery is:

            $(ELEMENT) or jquery(ELEMENT).


//So, if you want to see for instance, all the lists in a page, you'd do:

             $(".list")          or specific list: $(".list a")

                This will pull up all the lists.


//How many items in the list:
             $(".list a").length


//Select an item on the list:
             $(".list a")[0]


//If you want to extract the text from any specific item:

             $(".list a").text()            you can do this with any anchor tags(buttons, element tags (h1,), etc)


//You can pass in new stuff as well, such as:


             $(".list a").text('CLICK NOW')


//If you want to change a certain item on the list or any element:

                $(".list a").eq(0).text('click this')

              the eq() will specify which item # on the list, etc



//If you want to view the web-link that is assigned to any object:

                (".list a").attr('href')



//If you want to change the web-link that is assigned to any object:
                (".list a").attr('href', 'http://narf.com')
