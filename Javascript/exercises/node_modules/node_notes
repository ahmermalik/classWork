1. make sure you add your node_modules to git ignore.
                    .gitignore


2. if you include your modules, it will install it on everyone elses machines as well.
    each machine has it's own requirements, etc so you don't wanna mix it up.

                    do a 'npm init'


3. add a package


                    'npm install 'module-name' --save'
